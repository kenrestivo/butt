.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbutt\fP (broadcast using this tool) is an easy to use, multi OS streaming tool.
It supports ShoutCast and IceCast and runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows.
The main purpose of \fBbutt\fP is to stream live audio data from your computers Mic or Line input
to an Shoutcast or Icecast server. Recording is also possible.
It is NOT intended to be a server by itself or automatically stream a set of audio files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-d\fP \fIconf\fP
Allows you to specify a config file
.SH QUICK START
When you start \fBbutt\fP the first time, it will create a default configuration
file in in your home directory (~/.buttrc) on Linux and OS X or at
C:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Roaming\\buttrc on Windows.
.PP
In order to connect to a server, you need to add a new server in the config window. 
Just open the settings window and click on [ADD].
Now fill in the input fields with the server data and click on the new [ADD].
.PP
Adding Stream Infos is not necessary for connecting to a server.
.SH CONFIGURATION
With \fBbutt\fP 0.1.13 several new features regarding this topic have been
introduced.
.PP
The command line option \fB-c\fP <path_to_file> allows you to define a
new standard configuration path. 
This makes it possible to have multiple instances with different configurations
running. 
In case the file does not exists, \fBbutt\fP will create a default file.
.PP
[Save Settings]: Saves your current settings to the standard configuration
file or to the file that was passed to the \fB-c\fP option
[Export]: Saves your current settings to the given file
[Import]: Loads the selected file and applies the settings
.PP
ATTENTION: 
If you use the \fB-c\fP command line option and import another
configuration file by using the Import function, pressing [Save Settings] will
overwrite the file that was passed to the \fB-c\fP option.
.SH MAIN WINDOW
The dot matrix display shows you the current state of the \fBbutt\fP software.
The states are: idle, streaming, recording.
When in streaming and/or recording state you can cycle through the information
by clicking on the display.
You can choose between online duration, data sent, recording duration and data recorded
.PP
The [>] symbol shines yellow if \fBbutt\fP is connected to a server.
The [O] symbol shines orange if the [start rec. when connected] checkbox is activated.
The [O] symbol shines red if \fBbutt\fP is currently recording.
.PP
The coloured LED lights (vu-meter) indicate the current input volume.
For best listening experience for you listeners I suggest to have the
input volume below or within the orange LEDs. Never let the volume
go up to the red LEDs, they indicate saturation.
.PP
\fBbutt\fP 0.1.13 adds a new gain slider below the vu-meter.
The slider is only visible when the little [more/less] button below 
the [settings] button was clicked.
With this slider you can attenuate and amplify the input signal between \fB-24dB\fP and 
24dB, respectively. Double clicking the slider resets the gain to 0dB.
Use this slider only to fine tune your input signal. 
It does not change the operating systems input volume setting. Instead, the
input signal is multiplied by the given factor. Thus adding to much gain will also 
add a lot of noise.
.SH STREAMING
To start streaming just klick the play symbol.
\fBbutt\fP will try to connect to the server until you press the stop symbol.
(\fBbutt\fP might get unresponsive if you connect to a non existing server:port.
In this case just keep clicking on the stop symbol, it will stop after some
seconds ;-))
.PP
You can change the audio settings (bitrate, channels) while you are streaming.
(Works only for mp3)
.PP
Unfortunately, it is not possible to update the Stream Infos while streaming.
You need to reconnect for updating the Stream Infos.
.PP
However, at least you can update the current song on the fly.
You only need to type the song into the {Song Name} input field at the 
[Stream] tab and press [OK].
.PP
\fBbutt\fP can also update the song automatically from a text file.
The first line of the text file must be the name of the song.
As soon as \fBbutt\fP detects that the file has been changed it updates the
name of the song on the server.
A plugin for the amarok audio player can be found in the player_plugins/
directory.
Don't hesitate to write a plugin for other audio players.
Just mail them to me and I'll add them to the \fBbutt\fP package.
.PP
Stream infos:
In the [main] settings window you can add stream infos.
This allows you to deliver more details of your stream station.
For example the genre of your music, description of your station, web address etc.
.SH RECORDING
\fBbutt\fP is able to record and stream simultaneously, in different bit rates and
number of channels.
For example you can stream with 96kbit/mono and record with 192kbit/stereo.
Recording is possible in mp3, ogg or wav.
When recording in mp3 you can also have different samplerates.
.PP
To record you need to select the destination folder and specify a file name 
in the [Rec] tab. 
\fBbutt\fP will replace the variables %d, %m and %y with the current day, month and year.
e.g. "rec_(%m_%d_%y).mp3" -> "rec_(03_28_2008).mp3".
.PP
With the %i variable you can add an index number to your file name.
This means with rec_%i.mp3 \fBbutt\fP first tries to open rec_0.mp3. If that
file already exists, \fBbutt\fP tries rec_1.mp3 and so on\.\.\.
.PP
If the [start rec. when connected] checkbox is activated \fBbutt\fP starts the
recording immediately after being connected to a server.
.PP
To manually start the recording press the record symbol.
To stop recording simply click on the record symbol again.
.PP
Since \fBbutt\fP 0.1.13 you can also tell \fBbutt\fP to split your recording into
separat files every n minutes. Just enter a number higher than 0
into the "Split file every [n] minutes" field.
Let's assume your file name is "rec_(%m_%d_%y)_%i.mp3".
Then the first file is expanded to \fBrec_\fP(03_28_2008)_0-1.mp3, the second after
n minutes to \fBrec_\fP(03_28_2008)_0-2.mp3, the third to \fBrec_\fP(03_28_2008)_0-3.mp3, you got it.
