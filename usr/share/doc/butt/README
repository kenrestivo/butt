About:
------
butt (broadcast using this tool) is an easy to use, multi OS streaming tool.
It supports ShoutCast and IceCast and runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows.
The main purpose of butt is to stream live audio data from your computers Mic or Line input
to an Shoutcast or Icecast server. Recording is also possible.
It is NOT intended to be a server by itself or automatically stream a set of audio files.


Installation:
-------------
OS X: 
Mount the butt-<version>.dmg by double clicking and 
drop the butt file to the Applications folder.

WINDOWS: 
Just run the butt-<version>-setup.exe as usual and go through the
installer pages.
The default installation path might be unusual, but this way it is possible to install
butt without administration rights.

UBUNTU:
Butt depends on the following packages and their dependencies:
portaudio19-dev, libvorbis-dev, libfltk1.3-dev, libmp3lame-dev

Install the .deb package with
dpkg --install butt_<version>-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb

LINUX/MinGW:
First of all you need to have the following libraries installed on your system 
fltk-1.3, portaudio, libmp3lame, libvorbis and libogg
They are quite common and should be included in every linux distribution

Then you can install butt from source as usual:
1. tar -xzf butt-<version>.tar.gz
2. cd butt-<version>
3. ./configure
4. make
5. sudo make install


Quick start:
------------
When you start butt the first time, it will create a default configuration
file in in your home directory (~/.buttrc) on Linux and OS X or at
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\buttrc on Windows.

In order to connect to a server, you need to add a new server in the config window. 
Just open the settings window and click on [ADD].
Now fill in the input fields with the server data and click on the new [ADD].

Adding Stream Infos is not necessary for connecting to a server.


Configuration:
--------------
With butt 0.1.13 several new features regarding this topic have been
introduced.

The command line option -c <path_to_file> allows you to define a
new standard configuration path. 
This makes it possible to have multiple instances with different configurations
running. 
In case the file does not exists, butt will create a default file.

[Save Settings]: Saves your current settings to the standard configuration
file or to the file that was passed to the -c option
[Export]: Saves your current settings to the given file
[Import]: Loads the selected file and applies the settings

ATTENTION: 
If you use the -c command line option and import another
configuration file by using the Import function, pressing [Save Settings] will
overwrite the file that was passed to the -c option.


Main Window:
------------
The dot matrix display shows you the current state of the butt software.
The states are: idle, streaming, recording.
When in streaming and/or recording state you can cycle through the information
by clicking on the display.
You can choose between online duration, data sent, recording duration and data recorded

The [>] symbol shines yellow if butt is connected to a server.
The [O] symbol shines orange if the [start rec. when connected] checkbox is activated.
The [O] symbol shines red if butt is currently recording.

The coloured LED lights (vu-meter) indicate the current input volume.
For best listening experience for you listeners I suggest to have the
input volume below or within the orange LEDs. Never let the volume
go up to the red LEDs, they indicate saturation.

butt 0.1.13 adds a new gain slider below the vu-meter.
The slider is only visible when the little [more/less] button below 
the [settings] button was clicked.
With this slider you can attenuate and amplify the input signal between -24dB and 
24dB, respectively. Double clicking the slider resets the gain to 0dB.
Use this slider only to fine tune your input signal. 
It does not change the operating systems input volume setting. Instead, the
input signal is multiplied by the given factor. Thus adding to much gain will also 
add a lot of noise.


Streaming:
----------
To start streaming just klick the play symbol.
butt will try to connect to the server until you press the stop symbol.
(butt might get unresponsive if you connect to a non existing server:port.
In this case just keep clicking on the stop symbol, it will stop after some
seconds ;-))

You can change the audio settings (bitrate, channels) while you are streaming.
(Works only for mp3)

Unfortunately, it is not possible to update the Stream Infos while streaming.
You need to reconnect for updating the Stream Infos.

However, at least you can update the current song on the fly.
You only need to type the song into the {Song Name} input field at the 
[Stream] tab and press [OK].

butt can also update the song automatically from a text file.
The first line of the text file must be the name of the song.
As soon as butt detects that the file has been changed it updates the
name of the song on the server.
A plugin for the amarok audio player can be found in the player_plugins/
directory.
Don't hesitate to write a plugin for other audio players.
Just mail them to me and I'll add them to the butt package.

Stream infos:
In the [main] settings window you can add stream infos.
This allows you to deliver more details of your stream station.
For example the genre of your music, description of your station, web address etc.


Recording:
----------
butt is able to record and stream simultaneously, in different bit rates and
number of channels.
For example you can stream with 96kbit/mono and record with 192kbit/stereo.
Recording is possible in mp3, ogg or wav.
When recording in mp3 you can also have different samplerates.

To record you need to select the destination folder and specify a file name 
in the [Rec] tab. 
butt will replace the variables %d, %m and %y with the current day, month and year.
e.g. "rec_(%m_%d_%y).mp3" -> "rec_(03_28_2008).mp3".

With the %i variable you can add an index number to your file name.
This means with rec_%i.mp3 butt first tries to open rec_0.mp3. If that
file already exists, butt tries rec_1.mp3 and so on...

If the [start rec. when connected] checkbox is activated butt starts the
recording immediately after being connected to a server.

To manually start the recording press the record symbol.
To stop recording simply click on the record symbol again.

Since butt 0.1.13 you can also tell butt to split your recording into
separat files every 'n' minutes. Just enter a number higher than 0
into the "Split file every [n] minutes" field.
Let's assume your file name is "rec_(%m_%d_%y)_%i.mp3".
Then the first file is expanded to rec_(03_28_2008)_0-1.mp3, the second after
'n' minutes to rec_(03_28_2008)_0-2.mp3, the third to rec_(03_28_2008)_0-3.mp3, you got it.


Deinstallation:
----------
OS X: 
Delete the butt.app from your Application folder and
remove the configuration file from /Users/<username>/.buttrc

WINDOWS: 
Run the Uninstaller from the butt folder in your windows start menu.
Since butt 0.1.13 the configuration file will also be deleted!

UBUNTU:
Run "apt-get uninstall butt" and
remove the configuration file from /home/<username>/.buttrc

LINUX/MinGW: 
Run "sudo make uninstall" from the source tree. and
remove the configuration file from /home/<username>/.buttrc
